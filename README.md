# bkmrx.org

## Synopsis

[bkmrx.org][1] is an open source social bookmarking website based on [bkmrx.com][2], built in Perl, using the [Mojolicious][3] framework, [Twitter Bootstrap][4], [MongoDB][5] and the [Lucy][6] search engine.

## Setup

 - Use a server with Perl 5.10+ installed
 - Install MongoDB
 - Install the Perl modules listed in the INSTALL file
 - Run server!

### Setting up twitter integration

You need a twitter API key in order for the twitter integration to work. When you have a consumer key/secret and token/token secret, fill in the details in the _bin/fetch-twitter-api.pl_ script.

### Setting up the search engine

To be polite to webmasters, add a contact email address in the _$user___agent_ variable in the _bin/crawler.pl_ script.

On first run, you need to create the search index, which is stored in the _web-index/_ folder. In order to avoid any index duplication, I recommend installing the site, adding a few bookmarks, then running the _bin/crawler.pl_ script from the command line with the **--create=1** option.

This tells the crawler to create the index; only do this once (or delete the contents of the _web-index/_ folder), otherwise your search index will start showing duplicate results.

By default the crawler will only crawl 500 URLs at a time, and will only crawl them once.

### Cron tasks

Add the following lines to the crontab :

 - 0 0 * * * perl
   /_[app-dir]_/bin/fetch-twitter-api.pl
 - 0 0 * * * perl /_[app-dir]_/bin/fetch-github.pl
 - */4 * * * * perl /_[app-dir]_/bin/crawler.pl

You can view a working version of the software at [bkmrx.org][7]

## Deploying

### _How to deploy_

You can run bkmrx.org using the built-in Mojolicious morbo / hypnotoad servers, or through a reverse proxy such as nginx.
